		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This is RobJH.com. My personal website. It's still very much a work-in-progress and so some features are still missing. That said, I don't have a goal in mind, and I only work on this sporadically.</p>
		<p>You can navigate the site by using the shell in the header, using commands commonly found on POSIX compliant operating systems.</p>
		<p>To see a roster of the currently implemented commands, type: ls /bin; ls /usr/bin;</p>

		<h2>This Site</h2>
		<p>
			It's mostly vanilla Javascript. The site uses html5 features to improve performance, and maintain the shell between pages.
			Stuff typed into the prompt is not sent to the server, and by default your session is kept entirly in local storage.
			The act of navigating around the filesystem will access static assets on the server.
			As such, for the normal operation of the site; no database queries are executed, no session IDs are exchanged, and no cookies are set.
			I also have no intention of adding any analitics, social media sharing buttons, or any other kind of third party hosted scripts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Recent work as been focused on rewriting the old propriatry backend to a set of static files and a python generator.
			The generator and all the raw files get pushed to github every night, if the server's working properly, and can be found at <a href="https://github.com/robjh/website">https://github.com/robjh/website</a>.<br>

		<h2>Your Data</h2>
		<p>Theres a page for that; <a href="yourdata.html" data-path="/about/yourdata.html" data-type="html">yourdata.html</a>

		<h2>Todo List</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Add svg support so I can automatically upload documents to some directory. Ideally the upload process should be as hands off as possible.</li>
			<li>Document more stuff.</li>
			<li>Add more commands. Support moving stuff around in the filesystem and file permissions.</li>
		<ul>
