		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This is RobJH.com. My personal website. It's still very much a work-in-progress and so some features are still missing.</p>
		<p>You can navigate the site by using the shell in the header, using commands commonly found on POSIX compliant operating systems.</p>
		<p>To see a roster of the currently implemented commands, type: ls /bin; ls /usr/bin;</p>

		<h2>This Site</h2>
		<p>It's mostly vanilla Javascript. The site uses html5 features to improve performance, and maintain the shell between pages.</p>

		<p>The backend and JS now supports images, so here's a picture of a lovely kitty:</p>
		<img src="biscuit.jpg" alt="A very lovely kitty." />
