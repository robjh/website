		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This is RobJH.com. My personal website. It's still very much a work-in-progress and so some features are still missing. That said, I don't have a goal in mind, and I only work on this sporadically.</p>
		<p>You can navigate the site by using the shell in the header, using commands commonly found on POSIX compliant operating systems.</p>
		<p>To see a roster of the currently implemented commands, type: ls /bin; ls /usr/bin;</p>

		<h2>This Site</h2>
		<p>It's mostly vanilla Javascript. The site uses html5 features to improve performance, and maintain the shell between pages.</p>

		<p>
			Recent work as been focused on rewriting the old propriatry backend to a set of static files and a python generator. The generator and all the raw files get pushed to github every night, if the server's working properly, and can be found at <a href="https://github.com/robjh/website">https://github.com/robjh/website</a>.<br>
