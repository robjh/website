		<h1>Your data</h1>
		<h2>On my server</h2>
		<p>
			I dont keep your data on my server.<br>
			Any data entered into the header is parsed and interpreted locally.
			Your IP might be logged in the webserver's access log.
			I think systemd deletes log files eventually but I'm not sure.
		</p>
		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			This site doesn't use cookies.<br>
			When a site sets a cookie, it's sent to the server with every request for every asset thats requested until it expires.
			I want all requests to be as small, and as fast as possible. Using cookies would be counter to that goal.
		</p>
		<p>
			If for some reason you want to set a cookie for this site, youre welcome to do so using the `cookie` command. :)
		</p>

		<h2>Session Storage</h2>
		<p>
			Session storage is a javascript feature where data can be stored in your browser for the duration of the current session.
			When a tab or window is closed, the data stored in session storage is deleted.
		</p>
		<p>
			The site uses session storage to cache information about the filesystem.
			This is to make moving around the filesystem more responsive.
			Commands you type into the header are also stored in session storage.
			You can cycle through your previous entries by pressing the up arrow when the header has focus.
		</p>

		<h2>Local Storage</h2>
		<p>
			Local storage is a javascript feature where data can be stored in your browser and the data will be saved for subsequent visits.
		</p>
		<p>
			The site doesn't use Local Storage right now, but ultimatly the plan is to have an option to move some of the stuff in Session Storage into Local Storage.
